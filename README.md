This font was made to make masking text with bullets easier.

HTML defines password input fields as single line only, however sometimes that is not enough.
For example, if you want an input to contain a private key, but want the text to be hidden from view.

Changing the font for a text area to this font will cause all characters to look like bullets, while still containing all the original characters that will be saved when the form is submitted. No JS magic needed to hide the text and keep the line breaks.

The font covers almost all of the unicode BMP range with an identical glyph - a bullet-like character.
